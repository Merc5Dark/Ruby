## Ruby

Ruby is a dynamic, object-oriented programming language known for its simplicity and productivity. It was created by Yukihiro Matsumoto ("Matz") in the mid-1990s. Ruby's syntax is designed to be readable and elegant, emphasizing the principle of "optimization for developer happiness." It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

Key features of Ruby include automatic memory management, dynamic typing, and a flexible, open class system that allows for easy modification of existing classes. Ruby has a strong and supportive community, and it gained popularity especially with the development of the Ruby on Rails web framework, which is widely used for building web applications.

Ruby's philosophy, often summarized as "Matz is nice, so we are nice," reflects the importance of human-oriented design, promoting a positive and collaborative programming experience.
